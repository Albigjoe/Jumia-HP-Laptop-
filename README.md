This project involves a detailed web scraping exercise focused on extracting product information for HP laptops listed on the Jumia Nigeria e-commerce platform. The aim of the project is to collect structured data that can be analyzed to understand the pricing patterns, technical specifications, and product variety available to consumers on the platform. Using Python and libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas, I developed a script that navigates through Jumiaâ€™s product listing pages and extracts relevant details including laptop names, prices, RAM size, storage type and capacity, operating system, touchscreen availability, and store names. The extracted data is saved in CSV format for easy access and analysis.

Once the raw data was collected, I cleaned and formatted it to ensure consistency and accuracy, especially in areas like price formatting, specification extraction, and product classification. The cleaned dataset was then imported into Power BI, where I built a dynamic and interactive dashboard. The dashboard features key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the total number of laptops listed, minimum and maximum prices, and the average price of HP laptops on Jumia. It also includes visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts that display the distribution of RAM and storage types, the proportion of laptops with touchscreen functionality, and the breakdown of different operating systems (e.g., Windows 10, Windows 11, Chrome OS).

An additional feature of the dashboard is the ability to toggle between general Jumia listings and HP-authorized store listings, providing a comparative view of product pricing and availability. This allows for a deeper understanding of how products from verified stores differ from those sold by general marketplace vendors in terms of price and specifications.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical skills in data scraping, data cleaning, and business intelligence visualization. It showcases how raw web data can be transformed into meaningful insights to support decision-making, market research, or customer education. The project is intended for educational and portfolio use, and it highlights how publicly available e-commerce data can be leveraged to extract business value through technical tools and data storytelling.
